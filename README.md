This is a quick little guide for those of you who wish to change or add things to your keymap.   This guide will work for all the keyboards running ZMK.  I have crap grammar so bear with me :D

Go to my GitHub repo https://github.com/Opids14/zmk-config-ergo18 and fork it.

 Go to [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/). This will be the graphical user interface used to modify the base keymap. 

Log in with your GitHub account and authorize if needed.

This will reload and display a nice GUI where you can start editing your keymap as desired. There are many settings to explore here, you can add as many layer you want. The skie is the limit.

Go back to your GitHub repository and navigate to the "Actions" tab, where you'll see another workflow automatically running. Wait for it to finish. As long as it turns green, all changes have been accepted

Click on the new workflow once it finishes running, then download the firmware and extract the file

The computer should recognize the keyboard as NiceNano, just paste the UF2 file here and you're done. Enjoy the keyboard and happy holidays.
